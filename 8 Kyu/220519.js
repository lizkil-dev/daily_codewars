/* Convert a String to a Number
  We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?*/

//My Solution

const stringToNumber = function(str){
  
  return Number(str);
}

/* Return Negative
  In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?*/

//My Solution

function makeNegative(num) {
  return -Math.abs(num);
}
