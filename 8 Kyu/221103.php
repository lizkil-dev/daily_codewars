<!-- DESCRIPTION:
Define a method hello that returns "Hello, Name!" to a given name, or says Hello, World! if name is not given (or passed as an empty String).

Assuming that name is a String and it checks for user typos to return a name with a first capital letter (Xxxx).

Examples:

* With `name` = "john"  => return "Hello, John!"
* With `name` = "aliCE" => return "Hello, Alice!"
* With `name` not given 
  or `name` = ""        => return "Hello, World!" -->


<?php
// function hello($name = ''){
//   if($name){
//     $name = strtolower($name);
//     $name = ucfirst($name);
//     return $name;
//   }else return "Hello World";
//  };


 /* You're re-designing a blog and the blog's posts have the following format for showing the date and time a post was made:

Weekday Month Day, time e.g., Friday May 2, 7pm

You're running out of screen real estate, and on some pages you want to display a shorter format, Weekday Month Day that omits the time.

Write a function, shortenToDate, that takes the Website date/time in its original string format, and returns the shortened format.

Assume shortenToDate's input will always be a string, e.g. "Friday May 2, 7pm". Assume shortenToDate's output will be the shortened string, e.g., "Friday May 2". */

function shortenToDate($longDate) {
  return explode(",", $longDate)[0];
}
