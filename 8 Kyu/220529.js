/* Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List
Your task is to make two functions (max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language)
that receive a list of integers as input and return, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that list. */

// My Solution

var min = function(list){
    
    return Math.min(...list)
}

var max = function(list){
    
    return Math.max(...list);
}
